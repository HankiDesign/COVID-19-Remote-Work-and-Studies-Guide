# COVID-19 Remote Work and Study Resources

The COVID-19 situation forces people all over the world to work or study remotely for the first time in their lives. This repository aims to aggregate all the important information, free resources and other stuff that helps people make the best of the unfortunate situation and continue with their daily tasks.

## Note on Tools and Services
This list deals exclusively with free products/services and premium services that offer free plans for schools, companies and individuals affected by the pandemic. Unfortunately, some companies are trying to benefit from the situation by pretending their pre-existing free trials are actually free handouts, in which case they'll be excluded from the list.

## Contributing

For sure, there are many more great tools and services that I'm missing from this list. If you know of any, please submit a pull request and I'll review it. There are no specific styling instructions yet but try to adhere to the overall look and feel already present in the document. Keep the following things in mind when contributing:

- Use the icons provided for the feature listing. You can add new ones if they make sense and are general enough to be listed for other tools and services as well.
- If there's a separate announcement on an official blog etc. with more information about the offering, please link that in the Source column of the table.
- Don't add services that pretend that their pre-existing 30-day trial is suddenly a free COVID-19 exclusive offer.
- Keep the table entries in alphabetical order.
