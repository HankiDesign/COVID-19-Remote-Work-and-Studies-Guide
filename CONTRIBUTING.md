# Contributing

There are certainly many great tools and services that I'm missing from this list. If you know of any, please submit a pull request and I'll review it. There are no specific styling instructions yet but try to adhere to the overall look and feel already present in the document. Keep the following things in mind when contributing:

> Note for non-technical users: If you're not familiar with GitHub, or have no clue what a "pull request" is and you would like to contribute to this page, feel free to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hankidesign/). I'll add your suggestions if they're suitable for this page.

- If there's a separate announcement on an official blog etc. with more information about the offering, please link that in the Source column of the table.
- Don't add services that pretend that their pre-existing 30-day trial is suddenly a free COVID-19 exclusive offer.
- Keep the table entries in alphabetical order.
- Sites with excessive ads, paywalls or other limitations will not be accepted. Any articles listed in this repository should be of high quality and be original.
- If you want to provide a translation to your language, feel free to do so. All translations should go to a new file with a two letter language code (ISO 639â€‘1) suffix. (.e.g -fi, -se etc.)

## What is Needed?

- More free tools with proper categories for both distance learning and remote work
- More high quality articles for students to ease in the transition to distance learning
- Translations into other languages. I will provide the Finnish translation soon but other languages are up for grabs.
